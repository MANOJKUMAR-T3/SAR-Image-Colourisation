# SAR-Image-Colourisation
This project applies diffusion models for SAR image colorization in PyTorch, turning grayscale radar data into realistic RGB images. Features include a custom encoder-decoder pipeline, dataset preparation tools, training with MSE loss, and flexible single/multi-image prediction support.
